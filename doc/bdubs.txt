*bdubs.txt*	Quickly delete and wipeout buffers

Author: Josh Branchaud <http://joshbranchaud.com>

INTRODUCTION                    *bdubs*

This plugin exposes some commands for quickly clearing out that buffer list
that can all to easily become cluttered and overfilled.

:BD[N]        Uses |:bdelete| to delete all of the buffers in the
              |buffer-list| except for the current buffer. Because of the
              way |:bd| works, each deleted buffer will be unloaded and
              unlisted. If the number [N] is specified, that many of the
              most recently used buffers, including the current buffer, will
              not be deleted. >
                  :BD       " deletes all but the current buffer
                  :BD3      " deletes all but the 3 most recently used
                            " buffers
<

:BW[N]        Uses |:bwipeout| to delete all of the buffers in the
              |buffer-list| except for the current buffer. Because of the
              way |:bw| works, each deleted buffer will be unloaded and
              entirely removed from the buffer list. If the number [N] is
              specified, that many of the most recently used buffers,
              including the current buffer, will not be wiped out. >
                  :BW       " wipes out all but the current buffer
                  :BW2      " wipes out all but the 2 most recently used
                            " buffers
